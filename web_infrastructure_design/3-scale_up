1️⃣ Updated Infrastructure
Your new architecture consists of:

2 Load Balancers (HAProxy, configured as a cluster) → Distributes traffic efficiently.

1 Web Server (Nginx) → Handles HTTP requests and serves static content.

1 Application Server → Processes backend logic and business rules.

1 Database Server (MySQL) → Manages website data.

1 New Server → Helps split components for better performance.

2️⃣ Why Are These Components Added?
✅ New Load Balancer (HAProxy, Cluster Mode)

Reason: Ensures high availability; if one load balancer fails, traffic continues.

Cluster Configuration:

Active-Active → Both HAProxy instances handle traffic.

Active-Passive → One is active while the other is on standby.

✅ Splitting Components Across Different Servers

Web Server (Nginx) → Dedicated to handling HTTP requests.

Application Server → Executes backend logic independently.

Database Server (MySQL) → Keeps queries separate for optimized performance.

Reason: Prevents overloading one machine by ensuring each role has its own resources.

✅ Additional Server

Reason: Supports scalability by offloading processing tasks.

3️⃣ Infrastructure Benefits
✔ Improved Performance → Each server focuses on its own role. ✔ Scalability → More resources handle high traffic efficiently. ✔ Fault Tolerance → Fewer risks if a component fails. ✔ Better Security → Reduced attack surface by separating services.
